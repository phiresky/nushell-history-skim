# nushell-history-skim

Prototype of enhanced history search widget for nushell sqlite history backend using skim. Since it uses skim it probably won't work on Windows (for now). Shows juicy details of ran commands, allows filtering by current working directory.

Heavily inspired by [zsh-histdb-skim](https://github.com/m42e/zsh-histdb-skim).
